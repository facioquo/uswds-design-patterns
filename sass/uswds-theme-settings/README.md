# U.S. Web Design System settings

This folder contains a full copy of all [available USWDS settings](https://designsystem.digital.gov/documentation/settings).  As of v3.4.1, the original files are in node packages here:
settings available: @uswds\uswds\packages\uswds-core\src\styles\settings.

## Update these if new versions change available settings

If you are upgrading the version of U.S. Web Design systems in `packages.json`, you may find that settings options have changed.  You'll need to manually update our custom settings in this folder, or copy paste the source files again to fully reset.
